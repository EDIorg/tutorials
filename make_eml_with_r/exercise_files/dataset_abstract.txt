These data for water years 2011-2016 apply to the San Francisco Bay’s Central Valley watershed and fresh water flows into and out of the Delta. Factors controlling State Water Project and Central Valley Project exports from the south Delta were gleaned from various public agency sources when available, and when not available, were determined from the available information on flows and regulations and controlling factors on adjacent days.

# Make EML with the EMLassemblyline R code package

High quality structured metadata is essential to the persistence and reuse of ecological data; however, creating such metadata requires substantial technical expertise and effort. To accelerate the production of metadata in the Ecological Metadata Language (EML), we’ve created the EMLassemblyline R code package. Assembly line operators supply the data and information about the data, then the machinery auto-extracts additional content and translates it all to EML. In this webinar Colin presented an overview of the assembly line, how to operate it, and a brief demonstration of its use on an example dataset. This is the 5th webinar in EDI’s series on the [5 phases of data publishing](https://environmentaldatainitiative.org/resources/five-phases-of-data-publishing/).

A two part series on the PASTA+ Rest API.

Part 1: An overview of REST web-services and how they apply to PASTA, PASTA API calls commonly used to discover data, and some real world examples of interacting with the PASTA API.

Part 2: More specific information pertaining to PASTA’s search interface, including an overview of Apache Solr and how to interact with Solr to query for data packages in PASTA.
